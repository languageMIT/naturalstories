# Natural Stories Corpus

ðŸš¨ **Update 2025-05-12** ðŸš¨ We have discovered that the SPR data in the original release was misaligned by one position. The current repo corrects the misalignment. The other data is unaffected. If you have been using the dataset, we recommend re-running your analyses on the realigned data.

**Update 2020-11-11**: The repository has been updated with corrected alignments between SPR RTs and tokens in Story 3. In the previously-released files, the words after position 230 in Story 3 were mis-aligned with SPR RTs by one position. In the new files and alignment scripts, these errors have been corrected. For more details, see the `README` file in the `naturalstories_RT` directory. Thanks to Luca Campanelli and Cory Shain for helping us find and correct this issue.

**Update 2021-10-01**: Related to the update above, we removed erroneous RT datapoints corresponding to a blank token shown to SPR participants at position 231 in Story 3.

This is a corpus of naturalistic stories meant to contain varied, low-frequency syntactic constructions.
There are a variety of annotations and psycholinguistic measures available for the stories.

The stories in with their various annotations are coordinated around the file `words.tsv`, which specifies a unique code for each token in the story under a variety of different tokenization schemes.
For example, the following lines in `words.tsv` cover the phrase `the long-bearded mill owners.`:

```
1.54.whole      the
1.54.word       the
1.54.1  the
1.55.whole      long - bearded
1.55.word       long - bearded
1.55.1  long
1.55.2  -
1.55.3  bearded
1.56.whole      mill
1.56.word       mill
1.56.1  mill
1.57.whole      owners .
1.57.word       owners
1.57.1  owners
1.57.2  .
```

The first column is the token code; the second is the token itself. For example, `1.57.whole` represents the token `owners.` and `1.57.word` represents the token `owners`.
The token code consists of three fields:

1. The id of the story the token is found in,
2. The number of the token in the story,
3. An additional field whose value is `whole` for the entire token including punctuation, `word` for the token stripped of punctuation to the left and right, and then 1 through n for each sub-token in `whole` as segmented by NLTK's TreebankWordTokenizer.

The various annotations (frequencies, parses, RTs, etc.) should reference these codes so that we can track tokens uniformly.
